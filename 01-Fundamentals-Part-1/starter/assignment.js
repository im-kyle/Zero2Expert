// JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1

// LECTURE: Values and Variables

// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)

const country = 'United States';
const continent = 'North America';
let population = 1;

// 2. Log their values to the console

console.log(country, continent, population)

// LECTURE: Data Types

// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet

const isIsland = false;
let language;

// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console

console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);
console.log(typeof language);

// LECTURE: let, const and var

// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)

language = 'English'

// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

console.log('variables are set appropriately');

// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
// LECTURE: Basic Operators

// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
// then how many people would live in each half?

population = 0;

// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console

population + 1;
console.log(population);

// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
// Finland?

if(population < 6000000) console.log('My country\'s population is less than 6 million');

// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
// have less people than the average country?

if(population < 33000000) console.log('Yes');

// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
// people speak portuguese'

let description = 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese';
